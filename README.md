2. **Transcript Extraction**: TutorAI extracts the transcript from the video content.
3. **Course Outline Generation**: It utilizes Google Bard to generate a comprehensive course outline based on the video's transcript.
4. **Transcript Summarization**: The tool uses Facebook Bart to create a concise summary of the video's content.
5. **Question Answering**: TutorAI employs Hugging Face models to answer any questions you have about the video.

## How to Use

1. **Enter a YouTube Video Link**: Start by entering the YouTube video link of your choice.
2. **Course Outline**: Wait a moment while TutorAI generates a detailed course outline for you to follow.
3. **Summary**: Read the course summary for a quick overview of the video content.
4. **Ask Questions**: Have any questions about the video? Feel free to ask, and TutorAI will provide answers.
5. **Enjoy Learning**: Dive into your chosen topic, ask questions, and learn effectively with TutorAI.
